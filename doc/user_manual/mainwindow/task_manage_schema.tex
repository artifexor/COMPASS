\section{Task: Manage DB Schema}
\label{sec:task_manage_db_schema}

This task allows management of the database schema configuration and is reserved for expert users. It can not be run, but is performed using the GUI elements. \\

To make this task available use the 'Expert Mode' checkbox.

In this example, the current schema is shown in light red because it was not found in the empty database. As soon as data is imported, it is shown in a normal color. \\

Currently two schemas exist:
\begin{itemize}  
\item SCDB: Schema compatible to SASS-C Verif
\item SCDB Extended: Default schema, similiar to SCDB but with a defined RefTraj DBObject
\end{itemize}
