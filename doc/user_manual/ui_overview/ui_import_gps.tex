\label{sec:ui_import_gps}

This task allows importing of (D)GPS trails into the opened database, by parsing an NMEA file and writing the updates into the RefTraj DBContent.

There exist 2 tabs:

\begin{itemize}
\item Main: File path and information text
\item Config: Configuration of data source and secondary information
\end{itemize}
\ \\

\subsubsection{Main Tab}

At the top, a label exists indicating the file to be imported. \\

Below, a text field is given which after selection of an NMEA file displays the content information and/or error messages. \\

\subsubsection{Config Tab}

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

In the configuration tab, several configuration parameters can be set:

\begin{itemize}
\item SAC: System area code of the reference data source
\item SIC: System identification code of the reference data source
\item Name: Name of the reference data source
\item Time of Day Offset: Time correction factor, in seconds. Set to 0 to disable.
\item Mode 3/A Code (octal): Mode 3/A code to be set. Uncheck checkbox to disable.
\item Target Address (hexadecimal): Mode S address to be set. Uncheck checkbox to disable.
\item Callsign: Target identification to be set. Uncheck checkbox to disable.
\item Line ID: Line to be used during import
\end{itemize}
\ \\

\subsubsection{Running}

After selecting an NMEA file, using the 'Import' button the task can be performed.

Please note that based on two conditions, reference trajectory updates are skipped if:
\begin{itemize}
\item the time is the same as the previous update or
\item the quality is set to 0 (invalid position).
\end{itemize}
