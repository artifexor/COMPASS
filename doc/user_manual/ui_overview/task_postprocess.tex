\section{Task: Post-Process} 
\label{sec:task_postprocess}

This task allows calculation which data sources were active and of minimum/maximum data information, which is required for that later tasks or analysis functions.

The following information is generated and stored in the database:

\begin{itemize}  
\item List of all active data sources for all DBOs
\item List with all minima/maxima for all variables of all DBOs
\end{itemize}

This step has to be performed only once for each database, and may take up to a few minutes for large datasets. \\

\subsection{Running}

Using the 'Run Current Task' button the task can be performed. During import a status indication will be shown:

After completion the status window closes and no additional confirmation will be given. \\
