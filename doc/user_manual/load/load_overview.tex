\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Load window}
\end{figure}

In the uppermost part, the current tab can be selected. In addition to the 'Load', 'Evaluation' and 'View Points' tabs, views can be added to main window, per default a ListBox view exists. \\

Right of the tabs, the 'Add View' button \includegraphics[width=0.5cm,frame]{../../data/icons/crosshair_fat.png} is located. It can be clicked to add additional views to the current window or in a new window. \\

The 'Load' tab shows general database information, a list of database objects with loading functions and the available filters. \\

The 'Evaluation' tab allows adapting/defining requirement-based standards  and compliance assessment of said standards. For more information please refer to \nameref{sec:eval}. \\

The 'View Points' tab shows view points and allows for associated functions. For more information please refer to \nameref{sec:view_points}.

\subsection{Database Information}

In this widget, general information about the database is given. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \center
    \includegraphics[width=8cm,frame]{../screenshots/load_database.png}
  \caption{Management: Database Information}
\end{figure}

This also includes the database status.

\subsection{Database Objects}
\label{sec:load_dbos}

In this widget, information about the DBObjects, the loaded dataset, and the loading parameters are given.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \center
    \includegraphics[width=8cm,frame]{../screenshots/load_dbos.png}
  \caption{Management: DBObjects}
\end{figure}

Each existing DBObject is listed, and active ones have the following items:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Name checkbox: Defines whether data from this DBObject should be loaded
 \item Loading status information
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Idle: Nothing to do at the moment
  \item Loading: DBObject read/write in progress
  \end{itemize}
 \item Loaded data size: Number of loaded items / Number of existing items
\end{itemize}
\ \\

If a DBObject exists, but has no data in the database, it is shown as inactive (greyed out, like ADSB and MLAT in the screenshot).\\

Additionally, the 'Associations' label indicates if association information exists, and from which data source.



At the bottom, the following elements exist:

\begin{itemize}
 \item 'Use Limit' checkbox: If the data size should be limited
 \begin{itemize}
 \item 'Limit Min': If limited, the data set will start at the n-th index given here. If 0, it will be loaded from the beginning, if e.g. 100, the first 100 entries will be skipped and the 101st entry will be the first in the dataset.
\item 'Limit Max': If limited, the number given here will be the number of loaded entries.
\end{itemize}
\item 'Load' button: Starts the loading process using the current configuration.
\end{itemize}
\ \\

When a loading process is in progress, the button displays 'Stop' and can be used to abort the current loading process. Please note that aborting can take a few seconds during which the button is inactive, after successful abort the button states 'Load' and is usable again.

\subsection{Filters}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \center
    \includegraphics[width=14cm,frame]{../screenshots/load_filters.png}
  \caption{Management: Filters}
\end{figure}

At the top, the 'Use Filters' checkbox defines whether filtering is active. \\

Each filter consists of a checkbox, defining if a filter is active (contributes to the search query), a triangle-button (to show/hide the filter configuration elements), a unique name, and a manage button (activates a context menu). At the bottom an 'Add filter' button exists, which can be used to add new filters. \\

Please \textbf{note} that the filter configuration will be saved at program shutdown, which is also true for new filters.   At  startup,  all  filters  from  the  configuration  are  generated  and  restored  to  their  previous  state. However, when the database was changed (usage of different data source), all filters are reset to an initial
state (since their previous configuration may be senseless). \\

Please also \textbf{note} that active filters, at the moment, are always combined with a logical AND. Therefore,
when  two  filters  are  active,  only  the  intersection  of  data  which  both  filters  allow  is  loaded.   A  logical combination of filters using an OR operation is planned, but was not implemented yet.

\subsubsection{Data Source Filters}
Located on the left, for each DBO with a data sources list a data source filter is shown. For each
data source a checkbox exists, which is only active if the data source was active in the database. If checked, the
data generated by the data source is loaded, and otherwise not.

\subsubsection{Custom filters}
Located on the right, a custom filter does not differ in general  usage, but the inner workings are different. Also, it can be generated using the 'Add filter' button. It can also be reset (to the original values) edited and deleted using the manage button. \\

A custom filter consists of one or more filter conditions.  Such a condition involves a DBO (or meta) variable, an operator, and a value.  When active, the filter restricts all loaded DBO data to be fullfill all filter conditions. \\

As an example, the 'Time of Day' filter limits the loaded data to a specific time window, to load only time slices of the dataset.  The 'Mode 3A Codes' filter restricts to a list of (comma-separated) Mode 3/A codes, to single out specific flights. \\

For more information about filtering, please refer to Section \nameref{sec:filtering}.

\subsection{Views}
The 'Add View' button \includegraphics[width=0.5cm,frame]{../../data/icons/crosshair_fat.png} on the top right in each window allows adding views to the current window or in a new window. \\

Each View is contained in a tab within a parent window.  At startup, per default only the main window exists, which also holds
a ListBox view. If the main window is closed, the COMPASS client shuts down. New Views can be added using the 'Add View' button, which opens a pull-down menu. Each View can either be added to the main window ('Add Here') or into a new window ('Add in New Window'. When added, a new tab exists in the containing window. \\

New Views can be added either to currently existing windows as new tabs, or to a newly opened window. A window can be closed either by the close button in the window decoration, which discards all contained Views within the window.  \\

To close a single View, one can use the \includegraphics[width=0.5cm,frame]{../../data/icons/edit.png} button in the tab header, which frees up all its allocated resources. \\

Each View adds its required variables to the loading list for the database. During a loading process, the loading status  of a View is shown in the management tab.\\

Currently, the following Views exist:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \nameref{sec:histo_view}
 \item \nameref{sec:listbox_view}
 \item \nameref{sec:osg_view}
 \item \nameref{sec:scatter_view}
\end{itemize}
